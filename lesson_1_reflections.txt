things were different

 - How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

 dunno

  - What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

  pros: you save at places that matter and have no errors up to that point
  cons: user error

 - Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 git was created with coders in mind

 - How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 you first enter git log that shows you all the commits with your messages. then you find
 what you want and compare it to its previous or next versions with git diff (by their ids)

 - How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

 just like that

 - Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

 not sure
