 - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when you're collaborating.

 - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be changes from others that you don't want to enable.

  -   Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  forks help you edit people's repositories on GitHub when you don't have direct access to them. Clone downloads repositories to your computer. branches just copy your local commits.

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

you can see how a merge will affect things before you actually implement it on github.

 - How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

 preventing unnecessary changes to code would be easier. making changes to code would be harder(waiting for pull request, etc)
